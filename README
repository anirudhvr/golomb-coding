What
====

This directory contains a C implementation of Golomb encoding (and
decoding): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golomb_coding

The specific implementation is based on 'Compression and Coding
Algorithms' by Alistair Moffat & Andrew Turping, Kluwer Academic
Publishers, 2002. 

Also included are run-length encoding/decoding functions (because Golomb
coding works with positive integers), and a deflate (zip)
encoding/decoding function lifted from zlib.


How
===

The way to use the implementation is to take a character array you want
to encode, run-length encode it, and then Golomb code it. To decode,
apply Golomb decoding and then the run-length decoding.


Performance
===========

Is pretty good. See "Compressing Bloom Filters" in Section 5.1 of this
paper (this code was written to compress bloom filters for one of our
projects).
